# Product Requirements Document: PRD Creator MCP Server

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for developing a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server dedicated to creating Product Requirements Documents. The PRD Creator MCP Server will enable AI systems connected to MCP clients to generate detailed, well-structured product requirement documents through a standardized protocol interface.

### 1.2 Product Vision
The PRD Creator MCP Server aims to revolutionize how product requirements are documented, bridging the gap between initial product concepts and fully-specified implementation plans. By harnessing the capabilities of Model Context Protocol and Large Language Models (LLMs), this server will streamline the creation of comprehensive PRDs while ensuring consistency, completeness, and alignment with best practices in product development.

### 1.3 Problem Statement
Currently, PRD creation often suffers from several key challenges:
- Inconsistency in format and content across different authors and teams
- Incompleteness with critical sections often missing
- Misalignment between stakeholders on requirements and priorities
- Time-consuming manual processes for creating comprehensive documentation
- Difficulty maintaining up-to-date requirements as products evolve

### 1.4 Solution Overview
The PRD Creator MCP Server addresses these challenges by providing:
- Standardized templates and components for consistent PRD creation
